# Informed Choice Sentencing Reform Act — Model Legislation

**Repository:** `informed-choice-sentencing-act`  
**Status:** Ready-for-legislator model bill  
**Final draft:** December 11, 2025  
**Authors:** Two private citizens in open dialogue (with assistance from Grok 4 – xAI)

## Overview

This repository contains a complete, legislature-ready model bill that would:

- End mandatory death sentences and traditional life-without-parole as the only outcomes for intentional murder.
- Replace them with a post-appeals menu of permanent-removal options chosen by the convicted individual after every legal remedy is exhausted.
- Guarantee an absolute innocence-rescue clause for every non-execution path.
- Introduce low-maintenance, humane alternatives: monitored self-sustaining exile ecosystems, reversible pharmacological pacification, cryogenic suspension (when mature), and an open “Other” category for creative self-proposed endings.

The text is written in standard legislative format and can be handed directly to any state or federal lawmaker for review and introduction.

## Closing Note

This bill was forged in honest, sometimes fierce conversation between two people who began on opposite sides of an ancient question and refused to flinch from each other’s truths.  
We ended in a handshake.

May it protect the many without ever extinguishing the light of the one.
