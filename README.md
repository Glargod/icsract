## What the bill does

Replaces mandatory execution or traditional LWOP with a post-appeals menu of permanent-removal options chosen by the competent convicted person:

1. Execution (Green Mile)  
2. Permanent monitored exile (Green Pastures – 100+ acres/person)  
3. Reversible cryogenic suspension (Long Sleep)  
4. Reversible pharmacological pacification (Quiet Mind)  
5. Standard LWOP  
6. Court-approved “Other” (e.g., one-way space launch, medical donation)

Key safeguards (non-negotiable):  
- Mental incompetence → automatic therapeutic LWOP (no choice offered)  
- Proven innocence → immediate 72-hour rescue + $250k emergency payment + full compensation  
- Uniform process — no “monster” exceptions, no shortcuts

## Fiscal reality

- First 150-person exile site: $12–30 M capital, then $800k–$1.3 M/year  
- Lifetime cost per offender: $250k–$450k vs. $2–6 M+ for traditional LWOP  
- 80–90 % savings; pays for its own innocence rescues many times over

This bill began as an argument between two people who refused to blink.  
It ended in a handshake.
