        <pre>
A BILL

To amend [relevant state/federal penal code sections, e.g., Title 18 U.S.C. or state equivalent] to provide informed choice sentencing options for persons convicted of intentional murder after exhaustion of all appeals, ensuring permanent removal from society while preserving reversibility in cases of proven innocence, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the [Legislature/Congress] of the [State/United States of America]:

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Informed Choice Sentencing Reform Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—The [Legislature/Congress] finds that—
    (1) The preservation of conscious life capable of future love and choice is a fundamental value;
    (2) Intentional murder irrevocably harms society and victims' families, necessitating permanent protection of the public;
    (3) Traditional capital punishment and life imprisonment without parole may not fully respect the dignity of agency or account for the rare but documented risk of wrongful convictions;
    (4) Advances in technology allow for monitored, self-sustaining exile ecosystems that provide permanent removal without ongoing state intervention;
    (5) Reversible medical interventions, such as pharmacological pacification or cryogenic suspension, offer humane alternatives;
    (6) Allowing convicted individuals to make an informed, irrevocable choice respects free will while ensuring societal safety;
    (7) No sentencing option shall be imposed without safeguards for post-conviction exoneration.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to—
    (1) Replace mandatory death penalties or life without parole with a menu of informed choice options for intentional murder convictions;
    (2) Ensure permanent separation of convicted individuals from society;
    (3) Minimize taxpayer costs through low-maintenance alternatives;
    (4) Preserve the possibility of reversal and release in cases of proven innocence.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
    (1) INTENTIONAL MURDER.—The term "intentional murder" means any offense classified as first-degree murder, capital murder, or equivalent under [relevant code], involving premeditated or deliberate killing without legal justification.
    (2) EXHAUSTION OF APPEALS.—The term "exhaustion of appeals" means the completion of all direct appeals, post-conviction relief proceedings, habeas corpus petitions, and any other legal remedies available under state or federal law, including reviews based on new evidence such as DNA testing.
    (3) EXILE ECOSYSTEM.—The term "exile ecosystem" means a designated, uninhabited, self-sustaining geographical area (such as an island or enclosed continental site) equipped with initial survival resources, monitored remotely via satellite, AI video surveillance, and emergency beacons, but without on-site guards or ongoing resupply.
    (4) PHARMACOLOGICAL PACIFICATION.—The term "pharmacological pacification" means the administration of reversible medical treatments (e.g., implants or injections) that suppress aggressive impulses, approved by medical authorities and compliant with ethical standards.
    (5) CRYOGENIC SUSPENSION.—The term "cryogenic suspension" means medically induced, reversible hibernation or deep sedation, using FDA-approved or equivalent technologies.
    (6) PROVEN INNOCENCE.—The term "proven innocence" means a judicial determination of actual innocence based on new evidence, leading to vacatur of the conviction.

SECTION 4. SENTENCING PROCEDURE FOR INTENTIONAL MURDER.

(a) INITIAL SENTENCING.—Upon conviction for intentional murder, the court shall impose a sentence of life imprisonment without parole (LWOP) pending exhaustion of appeals.

(b) POST-APPEALS CHOICE PROTOCOL.—
    (1) Upon exhaustion of appeals, the convicted individual shall be provided with a 72-hour period for consultation with counsel, family (if requested), and a neutral advocate.
    (2) During this period, the individual shall receive full, unbiased information (in writing and verbally, recorded on video) about the following irrevocable options:
        (A) EXECUTION (GREEN MILE).—Swift and humane execution by the method authorized under existing law (e.g., lethal injection).
        (B) PERMANENT EXILE (GREEN PASTURES).—Transportation to an exile ecosystem with initial provisions for self-sustenance (tools, seeds, livestock, medical kits). Remote AI monitoring for emergencies; space allocation of at least 100 acres per person to allow isolation; rescue only upon proven innocence.
        (C) CRYOGENIC SUSPENSION (LONG SLEEP).—Induced reversible hibernation; awakening only upon proven innocence or future pardon by legislative action.
        (D) PHARMACOLOGICAL PACIFICATION (QUIET MIND).—Reversible medical treatment to suppress violence, followed by placement in a minimum-security open village; reversal only upon proven innocence.
        (E) STANDARD LWOP.—Continued incarceration in a standard facility under life without parole.
        (F) OTHER.—Any custom option proposed by the individual that is—
            (i) Legal and ethical;
            (ii) Ensures permanent removal from society;
            (iii) Irrevocable except upon proven innocence;
            (iv) Imposes no ongoing cost or danger to the public (e.g., organ donation after induced death, one-way space launch).
    (3) The individual shall rank or select options in writing, with informed consent documented. If no choice is made, the court shall impose standard LWOP.
    (4) The selected option shall be implemented within 30 days, subject to medical or logistical necessities.

(c) APPLICATION TO ALL CASES.—This protocol applies uniformly to all intentional murder convictions, including mass murders, repeat offenses, and cases with prior acquittals on related charges. No exceptions or expedited processes shall be permitted.

SECTION 5. INNOCENCE SAFEGUARD.

(a) REVERSIBILITY CLAUSE.—For all non-execution options, upon a finding of proven innocence, the individual shall be immediately retrieved, released, and provided with restitution as per existing wrongful conviction laws.
(b) POST-EXECUTION REVIEW.—In execution cases, if new evidence emerges post-implementation suggesting innocence, the state shall conduct a full inquiry and provide compensation to survivors if innocence is established.

SECTION 6. IMPLEMENTATION AND FUNDING.

(a) The [relevant agency, e.g., Department of Corrections] shall establish at least one exile ecosystem pilot within 2 years, expanding as needed.
(b) Funding shall be allocated from existing correctional budgets; private partnerships for advanced technologies (e.g., cryogenic) are authorized.
(c) Annual reports on program efficacy, costs, and any exonerations shall be submitted to the [Legislature/Congress].

SECTION 7. SEVERABILITY.

If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect.

SECTION 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect 180 days after enactment, applying to all pending death row cases and future convictions.

        <h2>Notes on the Bill</h2>
        <p>This model bill is designed to be adaptable. It draws from principles of restorative justice, utilitarian protection of society, and respect for human dignity. Legislators reviewing this should consult constitutional experts to ensure compliance with due process, cruel and unusual punishment clauses, and international human rights standards.</p>
        <p>If implemented, it could reduce costs, honor free will, and minimize the risk of irreversible errors—all while ensuring no convicted murderer ever re-enters society without proven innocence.</p>
