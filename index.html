A BILL

To amend [relevant state or federal penal code] to establish informed-choice permanent-removal sentencing for intentional murder after exhaustion of all appeals, and for other purposes.

This Act may be cited as the “Informed Choice Sentencing Reform Act of 2026”.

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
[Unchanged – see original]

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.
[Unchanged – see original, plus new definition below]
(7) COMPETENCE.—The term “competence” means the mental capacity to understand the nature and reason for the punishment, consistent with Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399 (1986), and its progeny.

SECTION 4. SENTENCING PROCEDURE FOR INTENTIONAL MURDER.

(a) INITIAL SENTENCING.—[Unchanged]

(b) POST-APPEALS CHOICE PROTOCOL.—
    (1) COMPETENCY EVALUATION.—Within thirty (30) days of exhaustion of appeals, two independent forensic psychiatrists appointed by the court shall evaluate the convicted individual. If both find the individual presently incompetent, the individual shall be transferred to a secure forensic mental-health facility and sentenced to life imprisonment without parole with appropriate treatment. Competence shall be re-evaluated annually; upon restoration of competence the choice protocol below shall be offered once.
    (2) If the individual is competent, the protocol continues:
        (A) 72-hour consultation period with counsel, family (if requested), and neutral advocate.
        (B) Full, recorded disclosure of the irrevocable options:
            i.   EXECUTION (GREEN MILE)
            ii.  PERMANENT EXILE (GREEN PASTURES) – as defined
            iii. CRYOGENIC SUSPENSION (LONG SLEEP)
            iv.  PHARMACOLOGICAL PACIFICATION (QUIET MIND)
            v.   STANDARD LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE
            vi.  OTHER – subject to court approval under the criteria in subsection (F)
        (C) Written, informed selection; default is standard LWOP if no choice is made.
        (D) Implementation within thirty (30) days.

(c) APPLICATION TO ALL CASES.—This protocol applies uniformly; no exceptions or expedited tracks.

SECTION 5. INNOCENCE SAFEGUARD AND RETRIEVAL PROTOCOL.

(a) REVERSIBILITY CLAUSE.—[Unchanged]

(b) PROVEN INNOCENCE RETRIEVAL PROTOCOL.—Upon entry of a final judicial order of actual innocence:
    (1) Automatic electronic notification to the Exile Monitoring Command Center (EMCC);
    (2) Activation of personal emergency beacon and 72-hour extraction by helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft;
    (3) Immediate mainland medical screening and $250,000 emergency payment;
    (4) Full statutory wrongful-conviction compensation fast-tracked within ninety (90) days;
    (5) Lifetime medical and mental-health coverage.

(c) POST-EXECUTION REVIEW.—[Unchanged]

SECTION 6. IMPLEMENTATION AND FUNDING.
[Unchanged – plus addition]
(d) An Innocence Rescue Trust Fund is hereby created, seeded by five percent (5%) of annual program savings.

SECTION 7. SEVERABILITY.
[Unchanged]

SECTION 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.
